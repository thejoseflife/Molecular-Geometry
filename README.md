# Molecular-Geometry
This program, coded in Processing, was inspired by UColorado's PhET Molecular Geometry Simulation. Users can add up to six single, double, or triple covalent bonds and unshared electron pairs to a molecule. The program will display the molecular shape, electron domain, and bond angles.
